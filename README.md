## Formatting

This project uses Prettier with the default rules. To format the entire project, run `npm run format` and to check if the project is properly formatted, run `npm run check-format`.

We recommend setting up auto-formatting on save in your editor. If you're using VSCode, these setting have included in the [workspace settings](./.vscode/settings.json) of this repo, so they should automatically work. If your editor doesn't support auto-formatting with Prettier, just run the format command before you submit a PR.
