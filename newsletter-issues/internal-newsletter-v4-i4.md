- **Europa NetApp Storage Updates — April 30 at 6 PM ET.** ACIS will be
  performing updates on our NetApp storage in the Europa Datacenter on
  Tuesday, April 30th starting at 6 PM. The outage window is expected to
  last until 10pm. During the update process, while unlikely, you may
  experience slow or interrupted access to storage while failover occurs
  between controllers. Applications and servers should automatically
  reconnect after failover is complete. If you continue to experience
  issues, most NFS storage related issues can be resolved with a restart
  of the server, service, or container.
