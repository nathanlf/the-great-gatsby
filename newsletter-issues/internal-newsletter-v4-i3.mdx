* ** UNC Advances Hurricane-driven Flood Prediction Capabilities for Coastal Communities. **RENCI, the Coastal Resilience Center, and Institute of Marine Sciences combined efforts under a grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to develop a better modeling approach for the compound flooding caused by fluvial (river), pluvial (surface flooding unrelated to rivers), and oceanic storm surge interaction. The resulting model advancement will help scientists represent river channel size variations and provide better insights into interactions between river channels and floodplains, as well as providing predictions to the decision-makers working to keep their communities safe during storm-related flood events. Read more [here](https://renci.org/news/unc-advances-hurricane-driven-flood-prediction-capabilities-for-coastal-communities/).
