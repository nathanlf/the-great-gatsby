    Standardized Sharing for Reusability & Discovery, highlighted the
    transformative power of standardized metadata sharing, particularly
    variable-level metadata (VLMD), through real HEAL Data Ecosystem

  experience slow or interrupted access to storage while failover occurs

  issues, most NFS storage related issues can be resolved with a restart
  of the server, service, or container.

- **DataBytes: Using GenAI to win STTR and SBIR
  Government Grants — June 20 at 4 PM ET.** Through a competitive
  awards-based program, STTR and SBIR federal grants enable small

  difficult for first-time applicants to get their foot in the door,
  between sorting through guidelines, requirements, and deadlines, and
  trying to locate successful examples. GrantScout is automating grant
  search, writing, and submission. The tool uses traditional deep
  learning methods and generative Al to unlock funding for everyone.
  Join GrantScout founders, Felicia Chen and Jennifer Tang, as they
  present how the government provides over two million grants for small
  businesses, the ways that their team fine-tunes their own models to
  create strong technical proposals, and lessons they've learned from
  past experiences that helped them build the platform. Learn more
  [here](https://datascienceconsortium.org/event/databytes-using-genai-to-win-sttr-and-sbr-government-grants/).

- **Data Matters Short-Course Series — August 5 -
