# ACIS Messages

- **Security Software Update.** In coordination with UNC ITS, the ACIS
  team is rolling out a security software update on RENCI-provided
  Windows and Mac laptops. This [Security Software Update
  Memo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cgZOz8_q3JbXt52bTyDf1HF0pv3gQ1zJ/view?usp=drive_link)

  Sunday.

- **UNC-Guest Network Use Update.** The UNC-Guest Network is used
  extensively for purposes it was not intended for, for example
  University business. This use of the network creates a security and
  regulatory risk for the University. The [upcoming configuration
  change](https://its.unc.edu/project/unc-guest-network-remediation/)
  will limit the use of the network to match its intended purpose for
  visitors and guests of the University.

- **ADSA'24 — Session proposals due June 1.**
  ADSA’24, hosted by the Michigan Institute for Data Science, will draw
  their focus to humanity in data and AI - humans as data producers and
  data engineers, as AI designers and developers, represented in data,
  as data and AI users, and as beneficiaries or victims of data and AI.
  Sessions will explore the central role of humans in the data and AI
  revolution: to maximize its benefits for research and innovation;
  ensure data and technology use and the insights align with our values
  and priorities; and ensure the future workforce are prepared to
  continue discovery and innovation. The team seeks session proposals on
  three tracks: research, training and education, and societal impact.

  conference will offer a dynamic atmosphere for educators, researchers,
  curriculum developers, and school leaders to exchange ideas and
  co-create the future of data science education in K-12. If you are an
  educator, researcher, content and/or tool developer, school leader or
  policymaker excited to share ideas, learn from colleagues, and jointly
  pave the way towards robust data science education and data literacy
  opportunities for K-12 learners, then this inaugural conference is for
  you. Learn more

# Upcoming Events

- **Phenotypic Data Exchange for Genomics and Rare
  Diseases: Vulcan Roundtable — May 31 at 4 PM ET.** Phenotype data is
  separately coded outside the EHR, delaying diagnostics and decreasing
  diagnostic rates. A group of stakeholders will discuss
  phenotypic-based use cases and interoperability challenges between
  different environments including research and clinical care. This
  session is intended for clinicians and researchers where detailed,
  computable, and individual-level phenotypic data is a core part of
  their use cases. Learn more
  [here](https://www.linkedin.com/events/phenotypicdataexchangeforgenomi7198979509096771586/about/).

- **DataBytes: Using GenAI to win STTR and SBIR
  Government Grants — June 20 at 4 PM ET.** Through a competitive
  awards-based program, STTR and SBIR federal grants enable small
  businesses to explore their technological potential and open new
  opportunities to profit from commercialization. However, first-time
  applicants may struggle to sort through guidelines, requirements, and
  deadlines, and locate successful examples. GrantScout automates grant
  search, writing, and submission. The tool uses traditional deep
  learning methods and generative Al to unlock funding for everyone.
  Join GrantScout founders, Felicia Chen and Jennifer Tang, as they
  discuss the over two million government small business grants, how
  their team fine-tunes their models to create strong technical
  proposals, and previous lessons learned and applied to help build the
  platform. Learn more

  is the largest Wikimedia research event of the year, aimed at bringing
  together researchers who study all aspects of Wikimedia projects
  (including, but not limited to, Wikipedia, Wikidata, Wikimedia
  Commons, Wikisource, and Wiktionary) as well as Wikimedia developers,
  affiliate organizations, and volunteer editors. Co-organized by the
  Wikimedia Foundation’s Research team and members of the Wikimedia
  research community, the workshop provides a direct pathway for
  exchanging ideas between the organizations that serve Wikimedia
  projects and the researchers actively studying them. Learn more
  [here](https://pretix.eu/wikimedia/wikiworkshop2024/).
