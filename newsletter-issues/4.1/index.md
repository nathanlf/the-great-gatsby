# Notes From OOD

- **Happy New Year 2024!** OOD wishes you all a successful, productive,
  and happy year ahead. We are proud of the RENCI achievements and the
  community we have built together and look forward to many exciting
  endeavors in 2024, not limited to celebrating RENCI’s 20th birthday!
  We are preparing for (good) changes and improvements in several
  areas, - and we will introduce them to you as they prepare. We hope to
  empower the spirit of cohesiveness, responsibility, and authority -
  and we are curious about your feedback. So, here’s to 2024!

- **2024 marks RENCI’s 20th Anniversary!** If you are interested in
  helping develop various celebrations, email [Jayasree
  Jaganatha](mailto:jayasree@renci.org).

# Projects, Funding, and Awards

- **iRODS Releases**. Consider upgrading your existing deployments.

  - iRODS Storage Tiering 4.3.1.1

  - iRODS HTTP API 0.2.0

- **Awards:**

  - **Congratulations to Brian Blanton,** whose CHEER award received
    additional funding for $169,500 in January.

  - **Congratulations to Stan Ahalt,** as the ICEES award received
    additional funding of $858,105.

# ACIS Messages

- **Mail Routing**. As communicated earlier this month, RENCI **external
  email routing** is changing. If you are wondering what the changes
  are, why we have to make them, and if they *do* affect you, continue
  reading.

  - **What do these email changes mean to me?** Short answer:
    probably nothing. For most RENCI email use-cases, nothing will
    change, including how you send and receive emails. This includes
    system generated emails from Sterling or Hatteras, emails from
    VMware-hosted Virtual Machines, and email from your RENCI Outlook
    account.

  - **What is affected?** These changes *might* affect sending
    emails from outside RENCI’s data centers using an email address
    formatted as
    [something@renci.org](mailto:something@renci.org).

    - For example, the RENCI Communications team uses Mailchimp to send
      RENCI emails. Because these emails are sender formatted as
      [jdoe@renci.org](mailto:jdoe@renci.org), ACIS needs to
      configure the domain so Mailchimp is an approved sender.

    - Note: This configuration only needs to happen when using services
      that send in the specific format
      [email@renci.org](mailto:email@renci.org). If a service,
      like Monday.com, sends a message formatted as “Monday.com on
      behalf of [jdoe@renci.org](mailto:jdoe@renci.org),” this
      service does **not** need to be configured.

  - **Maintaining an Approved Sender List?** Starting in February
    2024, major internet providers, such as Google and Yahoo, will
    require senders to their users have properly configured SPF, DKIM,
    and DMARC - three technologies used to create a framework of
    approved senders for a domain - to reduce the amount of spam emails
    sent and received. To be compliant and have our email delivered to
    their users, we had to make sure our email configuration was
    correct.

  - **Questions?** If you have questions about these changes or
    have been using an external email service to send RENCI emails, send
    a ticket to [help@renci.org](mailto:help@renci.org) - we are
    happy to answer your questions and address your issue.

# Finance Messages

- **Mileage Rates.** Effective January 1, 2023, the Internal Revenue
  Service (IRS) established new mileage rates for 2023. When a personal
  vehicle must be used, the allowable business standard mileage rate
  increased to 65.5 cents per mile. See 1501.4 – Procedure on Ground
  Transportation Expenses Including Mileage Rates for more information.

- **Concur Support Desk.** Travel Services is excited to announce the
  launch of the Concur Support Desk! Users needing support with Concur
  Request and Concur Expense may now navigate to help.unc.edu and enter
  “Concur” in the search tool. They will then select “Travel Services –
  Concur Support Desk” from the search results and enter their request
  for help. Users may request assistance via email response, phone call
  or a Zoom/Teams Meeting. A direct link for assistance,
  go.unc.edu/concursupport, is also available on the Concur page of the
  Travel Services website. Email inquiries sent to Concur@unc.edu will
  receive an auto-reply asking them to contact the Concur Support Desk
  for assistance via the UNC Help Desk. Questions regarding Concur
  Travel and assistance with booking travel will still be provided by
  World Travel, Inc. The Designated Agent Team can be reached Monday
  through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST at 877-602-4950 or
  [uncch_travel@worldtravelinc.com](mailto:uncch_travel@worldtravelinc.com).

- **Travel Request Naming Convention.** When submitting a Concur Travel
  Request, the Finance Office would like to request that effective
  immediately everyone start their report name with their last name (Ex.
  JOHNSON- SC23-Denver). This will aid the Finance Office in identifying
  expenses and ensuring that they are charged to the appropriate funding
  source.

- **NIH Prior Approval Requests.** NIH Prior Approval Requests are due
  30 days in advance of the proposed effective date. Failure to meet
  this requirement will result in corrective action by NIH. Please
  ensure that you are working with the Finance Office well in advance of
  any award changes that require NIH approval.

# Dashboard Updates

- **Switchboard Homepage.** The Dashboard team is excited to announce
  the Switchboard Homepage! Instead of navigating the Switchboard
  through the left navigation bar, we simplified the user experience by
  creating a homepage. Check it out by visiting
  [dashboard.renci.org](http://dashboard.renci.org).

  - As a reminder, the Switchboard provides a one-stop shop for staff to
    find information, and anyone at RENCI can create pages.

- **New Search Feature.** This Dashboard update includes a new search
  feature (version 1.0) - feedback welcome - and an updated feedback
  form, which allows staff to attach pictures.

- **Employee Profile.** Everyone is welcome (and expected) to contribute
  to the Dashboard's content by adding the information to the employee
  profile! If you are eligible to become (or are) a PI/co-PI, please
  list this information in your profile.

# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

- **Do you have ideas for future DEI activities at
  RENCI?**

  - As always, please email
    [dei@renci.org](mailto:dei@renci.org) to pass along ideas for
    future DivE In Sessions or for questions about the goals or
    structure of DEI at RENCI.

# Proposals

- **FARR mini research opportunities for advancing
  AI-readiness in earth sciences — Applications due February 21.** The
  FARR (FAIR in ML, AI-readiness and Reproducibility) Research
  Coordination Network is supporting efforts to increase AI-readiness in
  earth sciences communities. As one aspect of its activities, FARR is
  inviting proposals for focused, limited-term efforts to advance some
  aspect of AI-readiness in an earth sciences domain. Learn more
  [here](https://www.farr-rcn.org/get-involved/research-opportunities).

- **Mid-scale Research Infrastructure Incubators and
  Conferences for STEM Education Research with a Focus on Education
  Equity — Proposals due March 14.** The National Science Foundation’s
  Directorate for STEM Education notifies the community of the
  continuing collaboration with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the
  Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fund for Strategic Innovation (Schmidt
  Futures), and the Walton Family Foundation to offer Incubator Research
  Coordination Network proposal opportunities that support mid-scale
  research infrastructure effort development, especially those that
  enable research on the assets and needs of those historically
  underrepresented in STEM and that lead to greater education equity.
  This DCL continues opportunities for the field to incubate Mid-Scale
  RI ideas in STEM education, allowing idea progression through
  conception and planning, and placing potential PIs on a path to
  develop a future Mid-Scale RI proposal. The NSF-wide Mid-scale RI
  initiative is designed to support research capability implementations
  with total project costs between $4M and $100M. The initiative also
  supports future mid-scale RI design. Learn more
  [here](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2024/nsf24027/nsf24027.jsp).

- **RENCI Proposal Development Working Group** is
  developing resources and tools for NIH- and NSF-sponsored proposals.
  Check out this template and draft instructions for working through the
  NIH proposal process:
